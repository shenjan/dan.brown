    <p><big>In 2005, <mark>Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine</mark>, whose editors credited him with<wbr>
    “keeping the publishing industry afloat;<wbr> renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history;<wbr> spiking tourism to Paris and Rome;<wbr>
    a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along
    with it;<wbr> a flood of historical thrillers;<wbr> and a major motion picture franchise.”</big></p>
    
    <p>The son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with 
    the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a graduate
    of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing.</p>
    <br><p><center><big><i>Brown is currently hard at work on a new novel.</i></big></center></p>
