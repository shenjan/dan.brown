    <p><big>In 2005, Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with
    “keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome;
    a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along
    with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.”</big></p>
    
    <p>The son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with 
    the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a graduate
    of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing.
    <br><center>Brown is currently hard at work on a new novel.</center></p>
